# Node Structures
Object-Oriented exploration of node-based data structures and their implementations.  Worked on during the winter between 2020 and 2021.

## Contents:
* Nodes
  * Single Nodes
  * Binary Nodes
  * Map Nodes (variable children count)
    * Weighted Map Node
    * Edge (for weights)
* Linear Structures
  * Stacks
  * Queues
* Binary Structures
  * Binary Search Tree
* Graphs/Maps
  * Weighted Graphs
 
### Implemented Algorithms:
* Depth First Traversal
  * Pre-order, Post-order, In-order for Binary Tree
* Breadth First Traversal
* Pathfinding:
  * Dijkstra's Algorithm
